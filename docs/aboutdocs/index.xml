Basic modifications are made according to the Doks tutorial.
Theme Modifications #
Theme modifications are located in ./layouts/ and ./static/css.
Functional Modifcations #
In ./partials/header/header.html, hard-coded hrefs to direct to the project subdomain /devdocs to support Github project pages. On local testing, clicking Centralis and Get Started will lead to 404.
In ./layouts/index.html, modified layout and hrefs.
In ./markdownlint-cli2.jsonc, set MD009/no-trailing-spaces = false to allow for looser markdown formatting.</description></item></channel></rss>
